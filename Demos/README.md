# Building Apps with the Microsoft Graph REST API

This folder contains demos for the Microsoft Graph module.

## Demos

* [Create an Azure AD web application with the App Registration Portal](./01-arp-app)
* [Working with the Microsoft Graph REST API in Postman](./02-create-app)
* [Create & Configure an ASP.NET MVC Web Application & Configure it for MSAL](./03-create-aspnet-mvcapp)
* [Update the ASP.NET MVC Application to Leverage the Microsoft Graph REST API](./04-leverage-msgraphsdk)

## Running demonstrations

Each demonstration is included as source code for convenience. However, several of the projects rely on other source code repositories. It is recommended that you obtain the original source and configure the projects according to the instructions in those repositories.

Each project has been updated to leverage configuration files when possible instead of editing source code files.
